        <p>In the PaaS model: OCcloud9 provides a computing platform and/or solution stack typically including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server.
        Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.
        With some PaaS offers, the underlying compute and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand such that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.</p>
