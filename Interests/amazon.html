        <p>IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. One of the biggest costs associated with in-house IT solutions is maintenance and cost. Times have changed.
        The move towards outsourced servers, software, data center space, and network equipment is the only way businesses will be able to compete in today’s rapidly changing technological landscape.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        IaaS can be classified as public, private, or a hybrid type. Public cloud is infrastructure that consists of shared resources amongst a variety of users.
        Private cloud is infrastructure that exists and operates on a completely private network. The latest trend is a combination of the two into a hybrid solution or “hybrid cloud”.
        In any case, the benefits of IaaS cannot be overstated. 
        It offers variable cost, scalability, and quickly implemented hardware changes that function as a seamless service – rather than an IT headache.</p>
